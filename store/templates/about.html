                        <strong>Welcome to MaliMali!</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        MaliMali is your go-to platform for seamless item exchange and community-driven commerce. Our
                        app is designed to help people connect, share, and trade items they no longer need for the
                        things they value most. Whether you're decluttering, upgrading, or looking for something unique,
                        MaliMali offers a secure and convenient environment to make it happen.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Our Mission:</strong> To create a sustainable, collaborative marketplace where people
                        can trade value for value, reduce waste, and build stronger communities through the power of
                        sharing.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Our Vision:</strong> We envision a world where the boundaries of commerce are
                        redefined—where items have infinite potential and are passed from one hand to the next, bringing
                        joy and utility to everyone involved. Through innovation and community, we aim to become the
                        leading platform for item exchange globally.
                        <br><br>
